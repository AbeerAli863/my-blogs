<h1>How to Manage Your Time When Working From Home</h1>

<p>Working from home offers freedom, but without discipline, time can slip away quickly. Managing your time well is essential for productivity, income, and maintaining balance. Here are proven tips to master your schedule and get the most out of your work-from-home routine.</p>

<h2>1. Create a Dedicated Workspace</h2>
<p>Having a separate, quiet spot for work helps your brain switch into “work mode” and minimizes distractions.</p>

<h2>2. Set Clear Work Hours</h2>
<p>Define your start and end times. Share them with family or roommates so they respect your focus time.</p>

<h2>3. Prioritize Your Tasks</h2>
<p>Use a daily to-do list. Start with the most important or hardest tasks first — this boosts motivation and progress.</p>

<h2>4. Use Time-Blocking</h2>
<p>Divide your day into chunks for specific tasks or breaks. This prevents multitasking and helps maintain focus.</p>

<h2>5. Take Regular Breaks</h2>
<p>Short breaks refresh your mind and prevent burnout. Try techniques like the Pomodoro Method (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break).</p>

<h2>6. Limit Distractions</h2>
<p>Turn off social media notifications and keep your phone on silent or in another room during work hours.</p>

<h2>7. Set Boundaries</h2>
<p>Learn to say “no” to non-urgent requests during work hours. Your time is valuable.</p>

<h2>8. Review and Adjust Weekly</h2>
<p>Check what’s working and what’s not. Adjust your schedule to improve your productivity continuously.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Good time management isn’t about working harder — it’s about working smarter. Follow these tips consistently, and you’ll see your productivity and earnings grow!</p>
